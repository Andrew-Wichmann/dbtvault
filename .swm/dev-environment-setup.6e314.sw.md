## Installations

**Note:** This does not apply if you are using an internal development machine.

*   Install [PyEnv](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    
*   Install an IDE (preferably [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/))
    
*   Install git (if you don't already have it on your machine).

## Congrats

You now have your dev environment ready ðŸŽ‰
